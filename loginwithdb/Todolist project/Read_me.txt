In the early stages of the project, development based on Todolist features was the main focus of sprint:

1. Add, delete, modify and check
2. Filter and sort
3. Store and check manually
4. Case synchronization
5. Graphical interface

Todolist's features are not currently integrated into accessible software before Assignment1, and it may be planned for further development in the next sprint.
